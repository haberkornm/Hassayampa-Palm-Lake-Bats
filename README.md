# Hassayampa-Palm-Lake-Bats
Data, data analysis, and report of year long bat echolocation survey in 2021 of the Hassayampa River Preserve Palm Lake

A total of 18 species of bats were detected in 2021 (refer to table 1 below). Mexican free-tailed (TADBRA) and canyon bats (PARHES) were the most common species composing between 12 and 13 percent of all detections each.  One species detected in this study, the California leaf-nosed bat (MACCAL), had not been detected in previous echolocation surveys on the preserve.  Palm Lake was found to be an extremely important habitat year round for bats in the region of the Hassayampa River preserve, with significant activity found each month of the year.  Different bat species had different patterns of seasonal use of Palm Lake.  The majority of species had the highest levels of detections during the summer (ANTPAL, EPTFUS, MYOVOL, TADBRA, PARHES, EUMUND, MYOCAL, MYOYUM).  Only one species (LASCIN) had a peak only in spring.  Three had bimodal peaks during the year, often one in spring and one in fall (MYOCIL, LASBLO, NYCFEM).  Two species had peaks only in the fall (LASXAN, MYCMAC).
